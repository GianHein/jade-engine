# Jade Engine

Welcome to the Jade Engine repository! This repo features a game engine written in
Java, using LWJGL 3 as a backend. The repo follows the "Coding a 2D Game Engine in Java"
series by
[GamesWithGabe](https://www.youtube.com/@GamesWithGabe)
on YouTube, which can be found 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE). 
As I follow along with the series, I might make some changes to the code, or add some
features that I think would be cool to have. I'll try to keep the code as close to the
original as possible, but I might make some changes to the code that I think would be
better.

The original code for the series can be found
[here](https://github.com/codingminecraft/Mario).

This repository is mainly for me to learn how game engines work, and act as a primer
for me to learn C++ and OpenGL. I'm not sure if I'll ever use this engine for anything
serious, but I might use it for some small projects to get a feel for how it works before
I move on to C++ and OpenGL.
